Parking Management System – Architecture and Implementation Plan

Overview

We are designing a parking management system for a residential building that allows residents to share and reserve parking spots with a real-time availability view. The system will have a modern microservice-inspired architecture with a decoupled frontend and backend, emphasizing scalability, maintainability, and best practices. Key features include:

Real-time parking spot updates via WebSockets

User-contributed parking listings

Advance reservation scheduling

A credit-based incentive system

Flexible data querying via GraphQL

Tech Stack and System Architecture

Backend

FastAPI (Python) – chosen for its high performance and async support, serving a RESTful API and WebSockets for real-time updates.

PostgreSQL – primary database with proper indexing to ensure efficient querying.

Redis – session management and caching for performance improvement.

Frontend

React (JavaScript/TypeScript) – single-page application for managing parking spots and reservations.

TailwindCSS – for styling and dark mode support.

WebSockets – real-time updates on parking spot availability.

Flexible Queries

GraphQL – exposes a /graphql endpoint for customized queries.

Authentication & Authorization

JWT/OAuth2 – token-based authentication for secure access control.

Containerization & Deployment

Docker & Kubernetes – for scalable and portable deployment.

GitHub Actions – for CI/CD pipeline automation.

Azure VM – hosting Kubernetes cluster for testing and production.

Feature Implementations

Real-Time Parking Availability (WebSockets)

Clients subscribe to WebSocket updates on spot availability.

Backend broadcasts updates whenever a spot is reserved or released.

Redis Pub/Sub ensures real-time updates across multiple backend instances.

User-Added Parking Spots & Availability Management

Users register and manage parking spots.

Database enforces constraints on availability and reservations.

WebSockets notify clients when availability changes.

Reservation System

Users can book parking spots in advance.

Backend prevents double-booking using transaction locks.

Reservations update the UI in real-time.

Scheduled background jobs enforce booking periods.

Credit-Based Incentive System

Users start with 50 credits.

Reserving a spot deducts 3 credits from the user and adds 3 to the owner.

Transactions are atomic to prevent inconsistencies.

GraphQL API for Flexible Queries

GraphQL allows fetching only required fields (e.g., free spots with owners' names).

Secured with authentication.

Session Management & Caching (Redis)

Redis stores session tokens to support stateless authentication.

Frequently accessed data (like available spots) is cached.

Redis Pub/Sub enables WebSocket message broadcasting.

Deployment Strategy

Containerization & Orchestration

Each component (backend, frontend, Redis) runs in a dedicated container.

Kubernetes manages deployment with rolling updates.

PostgreSQL and Redis use Persistent Volumes for data retention.

CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Automated tests run on each commit.

Docker images are built and pushed to a container registry.

Deployments are triggered via SSH to Azure VM.

Security Measures

HTTPS enforcement for secure data transfer.

Password hashing and token expiration for authentication.

Rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.

Database Migrations

Alembic manages schema migrations.

Ensures production schema stays in sync with code changes.

Testing Strategy

Unit tests for business logic.

API tests using FastAPI’s TestClient.

Integration tests for end-to-end validation.

Conclusion

With this plan in place, we will proceed with:

Setting up FastAPI and database models.

Implementing real-time updates and reservation logic.

Developing the React frontend.

Configuring CI/CD for automated deployment.

By leveraging modern frameworks and best practices, we ensure a scalable, maintainable, and efficient parking management system.
